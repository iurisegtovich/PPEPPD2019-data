# PPEPPD2019-data

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/usnistgov/PPEPPD2019-data/master) Work materials for the All About Data workshop at PPEPPD-2019

## Getting started

This project is designed to work well with the MyBinder platform.  
For those who clone the archive to a local machine, they will have the option
of connecting to a local installation of 
[REFPROP](https://www.nist.gov/srd/refprop); otherwise, cached computations
in pickle files will provide the necessary visualization support.
